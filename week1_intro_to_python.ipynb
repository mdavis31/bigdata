        "before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words\n",

        "However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding\n",
        "it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast\n",
        "turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n",
        "'What a curious feeling!' said Alice; 'I must be shutting up like a telescope.'\n",

        "at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the\n",
        "little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not\n",
        "possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to\n",

        "out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.\n",
        "'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself, rather sharply; 'I advise\n",
        "you to leave off this minute!' She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very\n",
        "seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her\n",
        "eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a\n",
